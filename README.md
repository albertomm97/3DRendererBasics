# 3DRendererBasics
3D Renderer project for learning the basics of 3D Rendering without using GPU.

This repository contains all the files from Pikuma 3D Rendering Course that I've done in the past. I decided to refactor all the code and make my own implementation. In the end the goal is to create a simple game using the basic 3D Rendering Engine.

Currently the engine is capable of loading 3D models but the implementation is inefficient. Also, there is no camera implementation or system to manage entities (which is not the goal of the project) but the idea is to implement some kind of functionality that allows me to create a simple game.
